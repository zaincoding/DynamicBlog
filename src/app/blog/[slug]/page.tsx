    <p className="text-[25px]">
    In the vast world of web development, HTML (HyperText Markup Language) stands as the fundamental building block.
     It&apos;s the first step to creating websites and web applications, providing the structure and framework needed for everything from simple blogs to complex online systems.
     Whether you&apos;re just starting out in the world of web development or looking to refresh your knowledge, understanding HTML is crucial.
 </p>

 <h1 className="text-[35px] font-bold mt-[70px]">What is HTML?</h1>
 <p className="text-[25px]">
 HTML is a markup language, not a programming language, and its job is to structure content on the web. It uses tags to describe the content and structure of a page. 
 These tags help browsers interpret and display text, images, links, and other media elements correctly.
 </p>

 <h1 className="text-[35px] font-bold mt-[70px]">Why is HTML Important?</h1>
 <p className="text-[25px]">
 Structure: HTML is responsible for structuring all content on the web. Every image, link, video, or text element is placed within HTML tags.
Accessibility: Proper HTML allows websites to be easily navigated and understood by users, including those using screen readers or assistive technologies.
SEO: Search engines rely on well-structured HTML to index websites correctly. Tags like title , meta , and header help search engines understand what your page is abou

                        <p className="text-[25px]">In the world of web development, CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is the magic ingredient that transforms plain HTML into visually stunning web pages.
                             While HTML provides the structure, CSS is responsible for styling, layout, and design.
                             It’s an essential tool for creating beautiful, responsive, and user-friendly websites.</p>

                        <h1 className="text-[35px] font-bold mt-[70px]">What is CSS?</h1>
                        <p className="text-[25px]">  
                        CSS is a stylesheet language used to describe how HTML elements are displayed. With CSS, you can control the color, font, spacing, and layout of a webpage. 
                        It allows developers to separate content (HTML) from presentation (CSS), ensuring cleaner and more maintainable code. </p>

                        <h1 className="text-[35px] font-bold mt-[70px]">Why CSS Matters</h1>
                        <p className="text-[25px]">Design and Aesthetics: CSS allows developers to craft visually appealing designs, from color schemes to typography.
Responsive Design: Using media queries, CSS ensures websites look great on all devices, from desktops to smartphones.
Efficiency: With a single stylesheet, you can control the appearance of multiple web pages, reducing duplication.
Animation and Interactivity: CSS enables smooth transitions, animations, and hover effects, adding life to a webpage.</p>

            <p className="text-[25px]">
            In the ever-evolving world of web development, TypeScript has emerged as a game-changer.
             Built on top of JavaScript, TypeScript adds optional static typing and robust tooling, making it a favorite among developers for building scalable and maintainable applications.
            </p>


            <h1 className="text-[35px] font-bold mt-[70px]">What is TypeScript?</h1>
            <p className="text-[25px]">TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, developed by Microsoft, that introduces static typing to JavaScript. This means you can define types for your variables, functions, and objects, catching potential bugs during development rather than at runtime. 
                The TypeScript code is then compiled into plain JavaScript, ensuring compatibility with all browsers and environments.</p>


            <h1 className="text-[35px] font-bold mt-[70px]">Why Use TypeScript?</h1>
            <p className="text-[25px]">
            Type Safety: TypeScript’s type system reduces runtime errors by catching issues at compile time.
Better Tooling: Enhanced autocomplete, intelligent code navigation, and refactoring tools boost developer productivity.
Scalability: TypeScript is ideal for large projects, offering clear contracts for data structures and APIs.
Community Support: TypeScript is widely adopted, with strong support from frameworks like Angular, React, and Vue.

            Interfaces: Define the shape of objects and ensure consistency across your code.
Generics: Write reusable components with type flexibility.
Modules: Use ES6 modules for clean and organized code.
Compatibility: TypeScript seamlessly integrates with existing JavaScript codebases.

                            React is a JavaScript library focused on building user interfaces. Unlike traditional approaches, React uses a component-based architecture, breaking down the UI into reusable building blocks. 
                            These components can manage their state and react to changes, making web applications more dynamic and efficient.
